# Terraria Time Tracker

SVG files are from Wikipedia

I am keeping old versions too... because I did not initially develop with any repo.

Live at https://platima.github.io/terraria-time-tracker/

## Current Features
* Track the progression of time
* Track the moon phases
* Update the moon phase if you got it wrong
* Update AM/PM if you got it wrong

## To Do
* Add sky colours to output area (currently just day/night)
* Add option to 'beep' at key times such as ideal fishing times, new moon, etc
* Show key fishing info such as https://www.reddit.com/r/Terraria/comments/gop6ik/fishing_101/ 
* Tidy-up UI a little
* Fix white ring around the moon (new SVGs that are inverted would do it)
